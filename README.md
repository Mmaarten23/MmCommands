MmCommands is a project that is aimed at removing some of the repetitive tasks developers may encounter when implementing a command system into their plugins. 

The project itself consists of 3 main concepts:
- The MmCommand handler
- MmCommands
- MmCommandSignatures

The MmCommand handler will handle all the repetitiveness of performing basic permission checks, displaying a help menu, dispatching subcommands etc.
All the metadata needed to make this work is stored in the `MmCommandSignature` annotation. 

# First time user
